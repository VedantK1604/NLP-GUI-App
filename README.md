<h1>NLP Analysis Toolkit</h1>

<p>The NLP Analysis Toolkit is a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, a graphical user interface created using a GUI library, and a JSON-based login/registration system to provide users with a seamless experience for sentiment analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Emotion Detection using external APIs.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Sentiment Analysis: </b>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. The goal is to identify whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Named Entity Recognition (NER): </b>Named Entity Recognition is a subtask of information extraction in NLP. The objective is to identify and classify entities (real-world objects) mentioned in a text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Emotion Detection: </b>Emotion detection involves determining the emotional state expressed in a piece of text. The goal is to identify the primary emotion conveyed by the author, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>User Authentication: </b>Secure login and registration system using a JSON file as a simple database.</li>
